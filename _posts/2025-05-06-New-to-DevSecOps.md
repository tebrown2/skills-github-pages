I am an IT Program Manager with over 9 years of experience leading software engineering teams, and recently took a class to learn more about DevSecOps.  
I found the course through DAU: Intro to DevSecOps - which is offered through Coursera.  I would highly recommend this course to anyone who has a deep foundation
of IT program management and wants to learn more about the practice.
